# [Toric Quivers](#toric-quivers)
Generate and manipulate toric quivers, their flow polytopes and associated combinatorial structures. 

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)
This code was written to reproduce and augment results in [\[1\]](#altmannSchwentnerNillWiercinska), [\[2\]](#hille03), and [\[3\]](#domokosJoo). 
Originally written in python, a newer version is written in Macaulay2 to facilitate interfacing wtih other M2 packages such as `Graphs`, `Polyhedra`, and `NormalToricVarieties`. 

There is 1 main file at the moment:
**ThinSincereQuivers.m2** contains routines for generating families of toric quivers, for manipulating the graph and weight structures associated to a given quiver, and for generating and analyzing the combinatorial objects associated to a given quiver. 

The main routines in this file are listed in the file **m2_version/list_of_fuctions**(for a more detailed explanation, see the documentation pages generated by ThinSincereQuivers.m2).
