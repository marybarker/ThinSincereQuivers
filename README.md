# [Analyzing Flow Polytopes](#analyzing-flow_polytopes)
Generate and manipulate flow polytopes and their associated graphs

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)
This code was written to replicate the results in [1](#main_paper). Currently, it produces the quivers associated to a given dimension *d*, although not uniquely up to graph isomorphism yet. Further, it can analyze a quiver (directed graph with weights) and give information about the associated polytope. 
There are 2 major files at the moment:
* **graph\_cal.py** contains routines for generating all of the directed graphs that satisfy conditions to generate a flow polytope in dimension *d*
* **quiver\_cal.py** contains routines for looking at the quivers generated in **graph\_cal.py**.
